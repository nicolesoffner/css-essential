          <p>As a responce to the digital transformation, I worked on the implematation of the first CRM tool on South America for this company.
            The goal was to aim on a next level relationship management  with our costumer. The main challeges where comportamental, trying to change and present value 
            to the sales team, and develop a strategy that combined different data origins. Acted as the product owner of the implematation process for the sales and marketing tools for the Brazilian team, 
            as well as the project manager for the business unit. Worked with a strictly remote 
          team, based on a different country. Highlights where the best pratices on assertive communication, goal and objective focused team.</p>

          <h3>Awards Program</h3>
          <img src="project-thumbnail.png" alt="description of image">
          <p>The company used to spend the whole marketing budget on award creditation by non-rastreable credit cards. The whole processes took almost 70% 
            of the work time from the marketing team. The data about sales and awards engagement where not mesured or analysed. 
            Therefore, we developeded and managed million reais contract with a fidelity program supplier. Created the marketing engagement campaig for the brazilian territory. 
            worked together with the sales team on different tactics. The whole project took two years and we fineshed with a national campaing.</p>
