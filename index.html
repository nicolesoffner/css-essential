          <h3>Awards Program</h3>
          <img src="project-thumbnail.png" alt="description of image">
          <p>The company used to spend the whole marketing budget on award creditation by non-rastreable credit cards. The whole processes took almost 70% 
            of the work time from the marketing team. The data about sales and awards engagement where not mesured or analysed. 
            Therefore, we developeded and managed million reais contract with a fidelity program supplier. Created the marketing engagement campaig for the brazilian territory. 
            worked together with the sales team on different tactics. The whole project took two years and we fineshed with a national campaing.</p>
